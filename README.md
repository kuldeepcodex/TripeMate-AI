✈️ TripMate AI — A Multi-Agent Travel Planner with MCP

An open-source AI travel planner that turns a natural-language trip request into a practical travel plan with flight suggestions, hotel ideas, weather details, and a day-by-day itinerary. The project uses a multi-agent workflow built with LangGraph, LangChain, FastAPI, and MCP tooling.

Why this project?

Planning a trip usually means jumping between multiple websites, tools, and spreadsheets. This project brings that flow into one experience by combining:

a flight-search agent,
a hotel-research agent,
a weather agent,
an itinerary-planning agent, and
a final response agent,
all coordinated through a LangGraph workflow with MCP-based tool integrations.

Features

✈️ Flight research using AviationStack
🏨 Hotel suggestions using Tavily search
🌤 Weather lookup via a custom MCP tool
🧠 Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph and MCP
📝 Structured travel itinerary generation
🌐 FastAPI backend with a simple web interface
💾 Conversation state persistence using PostgreSQL
⚡ LLM-powered responses with Groq

State and MCP Integration

This project integrates MCP in several places:

Tavily search uses a remote MCP endpoint at https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/
AviationStack uses a local stdio MCP command: uvx aviationstack-mcp
Weather is implemented with a custom local MCP server in custom_weather_mcp_server.py
The MCP client is defined in mcp_client.py, which exposes async helper functions for:

tavily_mcp_search
aviation_mcp_call
weather_mcp_search
forecast_mcp_search
extract_destination
The main travel workflow in backend.py calls these helpers from the flight, hotel, and weather agents.

Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, make sure you have:

Python 3.10 or newer installed
PostgreSQL running and accessible
API keys for:
Groq
Tavily
AviationStack
OpenWeather
uvx available for local aviationstack-mcp usage (or adjust mcp_client.py accordingly)
Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/travel_db
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY=your_aviationstack_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
DEFAULT_ORIGIN_IATA=DAC

How the Workflow Works

The user submits a travel request.
The flight agent uses MCP-backed AviationStack data.
The hotel agent uses a remote Tavily MCP search.
The weather agent calls the custom weather MCP server.
The itinerary agent creates a practical travel plan.
The final response is returned through the web API.
